This is a Checkers Activity for the Sugar OS. More information will be added as the application is developed. 

Basic Requirements
------------------------
Users can play checkers by clicking a mouse to move pieces (not necessarily drag and drop)
Two players can take turns using the same mouse to play against each other
Turn order is enforced and invalid moves are not allowed. 
The board updates accordingly when a piece is jumped or kinged.
The game recognizes when a player has won
Players' peices can be easily distinguished visually, even on a black and white screen
New Game button resets the board

These requirements should be enough to get a basic application running.
After the above works, some possible additional features include:
Scoreboard
Multiplayer over the network
AI second player
